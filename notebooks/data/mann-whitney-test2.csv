# 
# A physician is interested in the effect of an anaesthetic on reaction times. 
# Two groups are compared, one with (A) and one without (B) taking the anaesthetic. 
# Subjects had to react on a simple visual stimulus. Reaction times are not normally distributed 
# in this experiment, so data is analysed with the Mann-Whitney U-Test for ordinal scaled measurements. 
# The table below shows the rank-ordered data:
